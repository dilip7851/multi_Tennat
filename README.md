📧 Multi-Tenant AI-Powered Email Platform
A secure, full-stack server-side web application built using the MVCS (Model-View-Controller-Service) architecture. It allows admins to manage users in isolated databases, and lets users generate and send AI-powered emails in real-time.

🔑 Key Features

🔐 Admin & User Authentication
Admins can register, log in, and manage users.
Each user is assigned to their admin’s dedicated database.
Secure login using JWT.

🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture
Each admin gets a separate MongoDB database named after their email.
Ensures strong data isolation, security, and scalability.

🤖 AI-Powered Email Generation
Users can create smart email messages using Gemini 1.5 Flash API.
Generated content appears in real-time using Socket.IO.
Emails match the formatting of user-typed input.

✉️ File Attachments & Email Tracking
Users can attach files and send emails via SMTP.
View the subject and body of the last sent email.

🔁 Email-Based Password Reset
Both users and admind can reset their passwords securely using via Link verification.

📡 Real-Time Streaming with Socket.IO
Live stream Gemini-generated content directly to the email input box.

🏗 Architecture
This project follows the MVCS architecture:

Model – Handles MongoDB schema definitions and data structures.
View – Frontend interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript like ejs.
Controller – Routes and request handlers for admin/user/email functionality.
Service – Business logic and integrations (Gemini API, SMTP, etc.).


🧰 Tech Stack
Backend
Node.js + Express.js – REST APIs & app logic
MongoDB – NoSQL database with dynamic multi-tenant setup
Socket.IO – Real-time data streaming
Gemini 1.5 Flash API – Smart content generation
Nodemailer (SMTP) – Email sending with attachments
Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Clean UI with live updates
Displays generated email content as users type or stream from API
